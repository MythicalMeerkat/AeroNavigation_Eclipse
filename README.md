# FlightPlannerGUI

Jeffrey A. Wilson

This repository hosts the files for an outside/extra project I have been working on in my free time. In hopes of getting a better understanding of both programming and creating User Interfaces I have set out to create a desktop Flight Planner tool. Instead of relying on Excel or tables in Word. This application allows you to enter/delete Waypoints, determine if you want additional data to be calculated for the Waypoints, and export the Flight Plan as either a project file (.fpp) of a text file (.txt) suitable for printing.

Futher tools, such as a built in Note Editor (currently implemented), guidebook reference window (coming soon), and a map uploader/reference window , allow the user to do all their planning in one easy to use application.

This application is being built in the Eclipse Nano Window Builder, using java.
